## Self-Introduction

Hi, my name is Olivia Link and I'm a junior studying journalism at Lehigh University. I am currently involved in the Brown and White, Lehigh's student newspaper, as an Associate Photo Editor, Sports Reporter, and Photographer. I'm also a leasing and marketing assistant at the Marshall Valley, a brand new student-living community here in Bethlehem.
